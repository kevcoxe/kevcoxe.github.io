## Why a blog, why now?
As a software developer, I'm constantly learning, whether it's debugging a tricky issue at work, experimenting with a new framework on the weekend, or refining how I approach a common problem. Over time, I have realized that these moments are worth capturing, not just for others, but for myself.

This blog is my way of doing that.

I want a space where I can keep track of what I'm building and learning, both professionally and in my personal projects. More than just the final product or the working code, I want to document the why behind the choices I make, why I chose a certain tool, what tradeoffs I considered, and what I'd do differently next time.

Sharing knowledge is a big part of why I'm putting this online. I've learned so much from reading others' blog posts, and I hope mine can offer the same value, even if it's just helping someone else feel less alone when they hit the same weird bug I did.

Lastly, I think this blog will grow into something like a living portfolio, a place to look back and see the progress I've made, the problems I've solved, and the journey I've taken.

Thanks for reading, and welcome!
