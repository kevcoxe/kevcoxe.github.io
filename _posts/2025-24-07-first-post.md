I have always been the guy who did not like writing. In high school I was told to write a 3 paragraph and I asked
1) How many sentences per paragraph?
2) How many words per sentence?

I wanted to narrow down my requirements to find the lowest requirement like it was some challenge. The teacher did not appreciate this. But I still passed.

Anyways, why would the guy who does not like writing want to start a blog?

## Why a blog? Why now?

I recently changed jobs and I had to update my resume and I had to think back on all of the things that I had done in the past years.
I wanted to update the list of projects I had worked on, but where was the list of projects?
Oh the list was in my head.

I want to archive the thoughts I have or the projects I have worked on (at least the ones I can remember and have time to write about) so that I can look back and see all of the things I have done as a reminder of where I came from.
I would love to inspire others (if anyone does read this) to keep improving and learning new things.

One day maybe train an AI on this blog so I can have my own chatbot to talk with about previous things I have done almost like an interactive resume.
In the end this is mostly for me, and if others enjoy then that is great!

I hope you enjoy.
